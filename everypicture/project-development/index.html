            <h2>Conceptual Changes</h2>
            <p>There were no conceptual changes, but finalizing the concept of using pictures from a beach that my family would regularly visit back home. I still need to figure out which images I wanted to include in my project.</p>

            <h2>Design Revisions</h2>
            <p>I wanted to change how the design looked overall, and this was done through testing out different layouts on figma. I explored 3 iterations of what I have imagined.</p>
            <div class="idea">
                <p>Idea 1: I wanted it to images to overlap each other so it forms like a continous picture. It would perfectly align with each other and users would be able to open these images in full.</p>
                <img src="images/everypic-comp1.jpg" alt="everypic-comp1" width="200">
            </div>
            <div class="idea">
                <p>Idea 2: I wanted there to be zoom-in points on the background photo. Users would be able to hover and open these images in full along with text for context.</p>
                <img src="images/everypic-comp2.jpg" alt="everypic-comp2" width="200">
            </div>
            <div class="idea">
                <p>Idea 3: I wanted it to images to scroll past the background photo. It would perfectly align with some elements and people could hover over to see the full image with text accompanying it.</p>
                <img src="images/everypic-comp3.jpg" alt="everypic-comp3" width="200">
            </div>

            <h2>Interaction Changes</h2>
            <p>Similar to my experimenation, I wanted to use filters from the CSS to make the images grayscale and slightly blurred at first. Upon hover or interacting with the images, the full colors would come back and would be clear to see. </p>

            <h2>Concerns and Questions</h2>
            <p>I am not sure which idea I am going with yet, as some of them are more advanced than the level I can handle it at.</p>
