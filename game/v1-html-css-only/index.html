                <h3>Game Rules</h3>
                <p class="rule-text">With magnifying glasses in hand, players take turn looking for the ladybugs with the most spots as possible. The more spots a ladybug has, the rarer it is and the more points you earn! After each search, players can choose to  test their luck looking for more or take a break and let their opponents to have a go to keep their score safe, But be careful—hidden among the ladybugs are pesky critters!</p>

                <p class="rule-text">If you stumble upon one, your turn ends and the other player gets a chance to hunt. Disaster strikes if you run into two unwanted critters in a single round! All your hard-earned points scurry away, leaving you back at zero. Guess the bugs weren’t on your side this time!</p>
                    
                <p class="rule-text">The first player to reach 30 points or more wins and is declared as the Ladybug Whisperer!<br>Ready, set, go!</p>
