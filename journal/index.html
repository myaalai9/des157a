                <h3>02. Overuse of Overlays</h3>

                <p>Overlays are a crucial part of website, but if it is poorly designed it can become a very frustrating feature and disruptive feature. The article, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</a> resonated with me as I have experienced websites that had overlays that were popping up and taking up a majority of the screen so I was not able see what page I was on before, not only does this create a sense of confusion but also creates a negative impression of that site. The importance of understanding what action the user is supposed to take is emphasized in this article, highlighting how overlays need to have purpose so there is a meaningful interaction and the user does not feel like they wasted their time. Especially if an overlay is view an existing image on screen, it may feel redundant and useless.</p>

                <p>As an designer who values the user experience, I feel like this article taught me how to think about how I can be more mindful when creating websites. Going forward if I include overlays in my website, I will evaluate the motivations behind creating it and refer to this article to see how I can make it to be efficient but also user friendly.</p>

                <h3>01. Best Practices For Form Design</h3>
                
                <p>The process of having to fill in a form can be a tedious process but the reading on <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">best practices for form design</a> offered many valuable tips on how different design choices can improve the overall user experience. By implementing some of the ideas in the reading, we can reduce the cognitive load and encourage the user to complete the form instead of abandoning it. As a designer, this article will be helpful going forward when designing our mad libs and building future projects in determining what is best for the user.</p><br>

                <p>One of the ideas that heavily resonated with me was creating multiple steps as I am able to see how much I have completed makes the process less overwhelming and burdened. As a user I tend to be motivated when larger tasks are split into smaller chunks as they seem more manageable. It emphasizes keeping things minimal and simple. This can reduce a lot of the frustrations that many users including me experience. Prioritizing simplicity, progress tracking and responsive design can turn what feels like a chore into a more rewarding experience.</p><br>

                <p>A good example of form design is <a href="https://www.wix.com/">wix’s</a> website creation. They ask users to fill in a form on the website they want to create, this is achieved through simple labels, step by step questions that don’t overwhelm the user and immediate feedback.</p><br>
